# sketch_backend
this is simple backend written for uploading sketches that can be used by websites as svg's/images to create a sexy landing page . this is for my brother maintaining frontend @anmol2004 at github . front end is not present at github .
now new contributer is @ansh7234


**   Now you can run that simply  by the docker command :

		docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -e link=http://flyploader.live -v $PWD:/project/ kumarnitesh2000/sketch_backend:initial
**
Now link is the enviroment variable in this after the POST request function will return to the link page .
In command we use volume as well to edit and make changes in the code .
its not the best practice but you can do.
